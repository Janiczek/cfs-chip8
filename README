CHIP-8 emulator in JavaScript (CoffeeScript, really)
====================================================

written by Martin Janiczek (martin@janiczek.cz)

based on http://codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/chip8.html
     and http://www.elephantsneverforget.co.uk/rg/chip8.html
     
- my first attempt to write an emulator, soo... :)

TODO: (sorted by priority)
-----
wrapping outside the boundaries in opcode DXYN
investigate the need of @ in front of variables
add slider/textinput for the speed of emulation
sound
memory dump in debugger

FIX:
----
START -> wait for it to finish -> RESUME -> now clicking PAUSE or RESET doesn't work
0xF0 test - works when STEP, doesn't work when START, and even then puts ERROR 3
Jumping X and O - throws errors into the console
